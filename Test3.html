    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>I graduated from King Saud University in 2020, actually the last day of the year 31/12, my subject was information science. 
      I have lived in Riyadh since I was born here, and I love being here in this great city. 
      I started an internship with Kall Trip supervised by Mr.Suresh and I discovered a new skill which is writing. I found myself writing a lot of words in English and enjoying it too. 
       I like to read novels and tech articles, also sometimes sport articles especially football.
      Then I moved to learn a new skill: building websites using HTML and CSS.  I started to learn and practice with MRS. Padmaja, Abdullah,Jawad, and Yara. They helped me very well when I had issues with launching the program until I finished it as you see now!
      I hope to learn more and get better results.
